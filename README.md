Hey Duwamish!
===========
For a brief summary, please view: [http://smartercleanup.org/](http://smartercleanup.org/)
Our goal is to build a geography based community monitoring platform. An excellent example was put together by the GarageLab collective for the [Riachuelo river cleanup in Buenos Aires, Argentina](http://quepasariachuelo.org.ar/).
