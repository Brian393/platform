<p><em>{{#_}}NYRP acquired the Hull St. Garden in 1999, preserving it as open space in perpetuity.  In 2017 NYRP received funding from the state of NY to renovate the Hull St. Community Garden.  Over the next few months, we will work with community members and local stakeholders to design a plan for the space and begin construction soon after.{{/_}}</em></p>
