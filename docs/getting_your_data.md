You can download data from the Shareabouts API in csv format.

To access a csv of any dataset, just add the `format=csv` query param to the end of the URL. For example:

https://dev-api.heyduwamish.org/api/v2/smartercleanup/datasets/trees/places?format=csv

You can also browse it using the web interface to the API.

Read more about getting your data in
[the documentation for the API server](/getting-your-data/).
