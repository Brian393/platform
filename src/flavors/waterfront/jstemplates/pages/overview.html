<h1>{{#_}}Hello!{{/_}}</h1>

<p>{{#_}}The Georgetown Community Council, King County and the City of Seattle are interested in jointly pursuing a King County WaterWorks grant to design for better community access to the river and less polluted stormwater runoff in the Georgetown neighborhood.{{/_}}</p>

<p>We've discussed three possible focus areas for the grant:</p>

<ul>
<li>The 1st Avenue Bridge area</li>
<li>8th Avenue South to Gateway North Park</li>
<li>16th Avenue South to the South Park bridge</li>
</ul>

<p>In your opinion, which area offers the best opportunity for improvement/access and why?
<br>
<br>
Is there another location you'd like to suggest and why?</p>
