<h2>How does PB work in Oakland?</h2>
<p>
Participatory Budgeting (PB) is an innovative democratic process that gives Oakland residents of City Council Districts 1 and 2 the power to set priorities for how federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds should be spent to improve low-to-moderate income communities in their districts. The projects that receive the most votes up to the maximum dollar amount will become the CDBG priorities for the district. In December and January, residents came together at events in their districts and online to discuss community needs and brainstorm ideas for funded projects that would benefit low-to-moderate incomes communities. In early February, volunteer budget delegates evaluated and prioritized those ideas and turned them into the priority projects that will appear on the PB ballot from February 18-22, 2017.
</p>
<p>
Following the vote, the City of Oakland will release a Request for Proposals (RFP), and city and non-profit agencies may apply for funds to implement priority projects. Community Development District Board Members in Districts 1 and 2 will review all applications in response to the RFP and make recommendations to the city on which should be funded.
