Over the years since the \n1940’s, underground storage tanks at the property corroded and al-\nlowed chemicals to leak into the soil and groundwater.  Eventually the \ntanks were removed an underground barrier, or “slurry wall,” was \nconstructed around most of PSC’s property in order to prevent further \nmigration of the contaminants. In 2010, a Cleanup Action Plan (CAP) \nwas finalized with public comment and input on behalf of the \nGeorgetown Community Council provided by Environment Interna-\ntional, a consulting firm experienced in contaminated site cleanups. \nThe Department of Ecology is close to releasing two milestone docu-\nments that are key to the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwa-\nter at the PSC site.  One is a review of the overall progress in the five \nyears since the CAP was finalized, and the other is more specific, relat-\ned to the particular technology selected to remove a certain hard-\nto\n-\ntreat contaminant (1,4-dioxane) from the areas where it is found at con-\ncentrations of concern. \nThe progress report is called a Periodic Review, and examines how \nwell the cleanup action has performed so far, makes sure that human \nhealth and the environment are being adequately protected given the \ncurrent progress, and identifies a few actions for improvement.  A Peri-\nodic Review will happen every five years until the site has reached its \ncleanup goals. \nIn the Periodic Review, Ecology reports that the cleanup is proceeding \nas expected.  However, new information is available about some of the \nchemicals being addressed in the cleanup, and Ecology is asking PSC \nto re-calculate potential soil and groundwater cleanup levels based on \nthe new information, to compare them with the cleanup levels from the \n2010 CAP. \nThe primary chemical that the cleanup has not yet effectively ad-\ndressed is 1,4-dioxane in groundwater.  The CAP originally specified \nthat the affected groundwater should be pumped out from a single \nlocation, treated with an “oxidant” (a chemical that breaks down the \n1,4-dioxane), and discharged to the sewer.  Today, it appears that \nthere are multiple hot spots of contamination, and Ecology believes \nthat a more effective method would be to inject the oxidant directly \ninto the ground in several locations.  A study is also underway to find \nout whether there are bacteria that can help break down even more of \nthe contamination.  Because this plan is different than the plan in the \n2010 CAP, the CAP needs an amendment. \nPublic comment periods will be held for 30 days for each of these doc-\numents, once they are released.\nLocal residents will be notified by a \nmailer.
