<p>{{#_}}This area has been under an impasse for more than 40 years, since religious Des Oiseaux College closed theirs doors. The land is registered under the Historical Patrimony in 2004, but the House revoked the decree and returned it to the new owners, who wanted to build first a hotel with 1,400 rooms and then three towers of apartments. In 2013, environmental activists claimed the park, and the Town Hall decreed it, but the government hasn’t bought the land from the current owners.{{/_}}</p>
