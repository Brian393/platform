<h1>Together, we:</h1>
<h3>Transformed the space</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed 200 cubic yards of debris and invasive plants.</li>
<li>Planted over 200 native plants.</li>
<li>Replaced 100 cubic yards of topsoil and 50 cubic yards of mulch.</li>
<li>Laid 92 burlap bags</li>
<li>Hauled out 4 1/2 giant dump truck loads of waste to the city transfer station.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Built connections to our neighborhood</h3>
<ul>
<li>
The beautiful new yarn flowers on the fence were made possible by 15 Latina senior women in South Park who partnered with us and spent 100+ hours crocheting and knitting.
</li>
<li>
We unearthed a historical treasure that had been buried and forgotten. An old brick sidewalk that once connected the old neighborhoods together, in an area used to known as "Catholic Hill." Things changed in 1967, when the freeway was constructed and divided the neighborhoods.
