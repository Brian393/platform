Windows Local Setup
===========

Hey Duwamish! requires Python 2.6 or greater  (and PostgreSQL development libraries by default to build).

Install `pip` and `virtualenv`, if not already installed. These will keep your python code isolated from the rest of your machine and ensure you have the correct versions.
```
easy_install pip
pip install virtualenv
```


===========

Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python is required. 

For version 2.7, get it from http://aka.ms/vcpython27 and install.

===========


Create a new virtual environment inside of the repository folder:
```
virtualenv env
env\scripts\activate
```
===========


Install the project requirements:
```
pip install -r app-requirements.txt
```


===========

Congratulations! You have now installed our platform. To configure your installation and run the server, follow the steps in our documentation here: https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish#configuring-the-dev-api
