<p>{{#_}}The Casa de Campo is a historic garden and the largest public park in the municipality of Madrid (España). It is situated west of the city and belongs to the Casa de Campo neighborhood, Moncloa-Aravaca district. With an extension of 1.722,6 hectares, it emerged from a hunting ground of Spanish royalty and has been a public park since 1931, used especially for entertainment and sports on weekends and holidays.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}Madrid Río was open in 2011, on the banks of the Manzanares river, which until then had been inaccessible and hadn't distinguished itself as a point of attraction for the city, but as a place to which it has turned its back. With the project the area began to attract the attention of the Madrid natives, offering the children 17 playgrounds and adults biohealthy and cultural activities (exhibitions, music, theater) that take place in Matadero Madrid.{{/_}}</p>
