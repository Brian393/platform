<p>is an innovative democratic process that gives Oakland residents in City Council District 2  the power to decide how to spend city funds in their district.</p>

<h4>Idea submission for the PB process in District 2 is now open! If you have an idea for a project to improve your district, please share it on the map!</h4>
<br>
<p>In the Spring, community members will review all of the ideas we have received, and develop them into full proposals. In May, all district residents will vote on the top projects.</p>
